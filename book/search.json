    "text": "What kind of Language is Python ?\nThere are some things worth knowing about the python language before diving in. Perhaps the most important thing to be aware of is that python is an interpreted language rather than a compiled language so there is no translation to fast, machine-executable, binary code. This firmly places efficient coding ahead of fast execution and says a great deal about the philosophy of python as a language: applicable to a very broad class of problems, easy to read and high-level so that it is straightforward to re-use and build upon existing software.\nPython is supposed to be easy to use: it does not require you to specify (“declare”) the type of your variables or data before using them and it is happy to convert automatically from one type to another when it makes sense to do so. For example, a floating point 1.0 and an integer 1 are mostly interchangeable in python as they are in everyday life. When you have finished using a variable, there is no need to explicitly delete it though you can if you wish. Python is generally very permissive: there are usually many different ways to write something in python and the one that is easiest to follow is usually the best option to choose.\nPython has extensive exception handling which simply means that errors can be handled by the running program not always resulting in a crash that is deal with by the operating system. In general, it is a good idea to write code that understands what might go wrong and provides an elegant landing if something does. Exceptions also lead to a try it and see approach to programming. It can be easier to write code to catch an error than to try to write code that accounts for every situation without fail (at some point it will fail anyway !).\nPython is also an object oriented language and it is impossible to read python without understanding how it describes its objects and then refers to them. The principle of object-oriented languages is to encapsulate data and operations on that data into “objects” that can be passed around as a single entity and which you then can use without having to know all the internal structure of the object. This is a key part of our earlier discussion about the importance of being able to create abstractions in programming. In object-oriented languages, we typically describe a class of objects that have certain properties (data, operations, structure) without necessarily knowing the details of how those objects are implemented. We can be handed classes and told how to use them, copy them, extend them and so on without having to pull them apart first.\nPython is based around libraries in the form of modules that we import when we need to use them. There are very many modules in the standard python library for doing nearly everything from the operating-system level (make a directory, open a file) to high-level access to internet resources, string manipulations, regular expression parsing, mathematical functions … [links would be helpful]. Once a module is imported, the functions and classes that it defines become available to the program and to make life simpler, the names of all those functions and classes are prefaced by the module name when they are used. That means math.sin is not confused with religion.sin which might take a bit more typing for a programmer but does improve readability and makes life much, much easier for anyone developing a library.\nIf you write some useful code, it is common to bundle it into the form of a module and then to distribute it by uploading a package to a standard location. These packages are then distributed to users via a package manager which is smart enough to make sure that you are installing a version that works on your machine and (more complicated) is consistent with all the other packages you have installed.\nThe two main package managers for python are pip and conda. pip is a little bit more simple and really just worries about installing python packages and their python dependencies. pip is usually used in conjunction with other package managers to handle other dependencies that are distributed as binary libraries (things not derived from python - for example visualisation packages, compilers, language parsers, numerical libraries written in fortran). conda is a great deal more ambitious than pip- it manages entire environments that also include non-python libraries that packages might need. conda is more powerful than pip and tries to replace many other package managers that exist in the non-python world. If you do opt for conda, you really should go the whole nine-yards and try to use it to manage everything. conda creates virtual environments which allow you to have multiple set-ups on a single machine - handy if you have packages that need different versions of python or which have incompatible dependencies. conda is very handy for cloud computing because it a simple text file is (usually) enough to specify how to set up a cloud machine to run the environment you need.",

Before we can do much with python, we generally need to import the modules with the extra functionality we need. The print function is unusual in not needing to be imported, nearly everything else we want to do needs an import first\nFor example, the standard python library comes with modules for basic file system operations, string manipulation, mathematical functions, spawning processes … and so on. The full list is in the python documentation. These capabilities are provided (if you have downloaded python, you have these modules) but are not automatically activated.\nHere are a couple of examples:\nimport math\n\nprint(math.sin(math.pi/2))\nprint(math.cos(math.pi/2))\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n1.0\n6.123233995736766e-17\nSee how the module.function works. Sometimes, you just want to import a few bits and pieces and you can save some typing by importing those functions at the base level - they can then be used without referencing the module name (if the names do not clash, of course, and provided you remember to import everything you need !)\n\nfrom math import sin, pi\n\nprint(sin(pi/2))\nprint(cos(pi/2))\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n1.0\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-7-2b3c4d0b7471&gt; in &lt;module&gt;\n      4 \n      5 #\n----&gt; 6 print(cos(pi/2))\n\nNameError: name 'cos' is not defined\nYou can change the names when you import to avoid clashes. Here is an example using cmath which is the complex math library complementary to the standard (real numbers) math library.\nfrom math import sin, pi\nfrom cmath import sin as csin \n\nprint(sin(pi/2))\nprint(csin(pi/2))\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n1.0\n(1+0j)\nIf it makes sense to you, import modules under a different name too\nimport math as real_math\nimport cmath as complex_math\n\nprint(real_math.sin(real_math.pi))",

    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nIn this section we’ll discover how to run a basic python script (in the web browser) and what to expect in terms of editing, reloading, printing output and saving our work.\n\n\nThere are many different ways to run python code. For the simplest tasks, a web browser is all you need to edit and run simple tasks. In this introductory session, we will use a python interpreter embedded in each web page to learn the basic language itself.\nYou will find examples of python code such as this one which contains some Python code which you can copy but which you can’t run and you can’t edit. Note that the code is highlighted (coloured) by meaning.\n\n# A simple script (with a descriptive comment)\nprint(\"Welcome to python !\")\n\nWe use these blocks to give you examples and fragments of code that you can use later. Other code blocks have a run button and they can usually be edited (and, don’t worry, they can be reset if you make a mistake). We use these live code blocks for you to try things out. Give it a go (you can’t break anything).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGenerally, we’ll use the live code blocks as part of an exercise for you to try something specific.

You can also use the run button if you prefer.\nNote there is a clipboard button to copy your answer and this is quite important because it is not saved anywhere. If you want to keep answers to your exercises, have a separate notebook / editor handy.\nWhen you have finished, you can collapse this exercise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually we will collapse the exercises by default and you’ll need to open them to access the instructions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - Calculations\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve already seen a couple of examples of Python code. Now let’s try making something from scratch. One thing we can do is simply use Python like a calculator!\nTry typing simple arithmetic into the code cell below and see what happens. For example, try entering\n3+17\nYou can also use the operators *, -, / (for division), and the parentheses (). Finally, ** is used to raise a number to some power, so that \\(3^2\\) is entered as 3**2. Keep trying new calculations !\nWhat happens if you enter two lines of calculations and run ? For example:\n3+17\n5*9\nCan you think how to get both of the answers to (hint) print out ?\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nComments\nIn the examples above, you may have noticed the line\n# A simple script (with a descriptive comment)\nwhich doesn’t look as though it ought to be valid Python code. This is a ‘comment’ line: the computer ignores the # and anything following it on the same line. Comments should be used to document information that helps people to understand how the code works internally. This may seem like a waste of time - but you (or your colleagues) will be grateful in two years’ time when you find you need to change something! The comment character can also be useful for ‘switching off’ lines of code without deleting them. For example, look at this piece of code:\ndef readDataFile(fp):\n    # This function assumes that fp is\n    # a valid file-like object and that the\n    # file has already been opened for reading\n    header = fp.readline()\n    # print(header)\n    [...]\nThe first three lines of comments provide information recording some of the assumptions the programmer made when writing this function (don’t worry if it doesn’t make sense yet!). The fourth comment line is a piece of code that has been ‘commented out’: we don’t want to routinely print the file header, but it is useful to be able to reinstate this easily in case we encounter problems and need to check what the function has read.\nIn fact, ‘commenting out’ code is so common that most editors provide a straightforward way to do it. If you select a block of code and press Ctrl+/ (or on a Mac, ⌘+/), the selected lines will all be changed to begin with # comment characters. Pressing Ctrl+/ again will restore the original version. Smart editors know how to do this for many different languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding scratch space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "Naming Conventions",
    "text": "Naming Conventions\nYou can call your variables anything you like. However, following a few conventions will improve the clarity of your code:\n\nIf your variable name is made up of multiple words, either:\n\nJoin them using underscores (e.g. a_long_variable_name = 17), or\nCapitalize the first letter of each word (e.g. AnotherLongVariableName = 23.6). This is sometimes referred to as ‘camel case’ or ‘CamelCase’(since it is lower case with extra humps!).\n\nIt is common but not compulsory to use UPPER CASE for constants that should never need to be changed within the program, e.g. GRAVITATIONAL_ACCELERATION = 9.81.\nTraditionally, variables that contain integers have names beginning with the letters i, j, k, l, m, or n; variables containing real numbers start with any other letter. This comes from early programming languages (especially Fortran) where it was a requirement, and follows a similar convention in mathematics. Nowadays, this convention is often ignored for long variable names. However, if your name only contains one or two characters (e.g. a or ix), it is usual to choose the first letter appropriately. In particular, a bare i, j, k, m or n should only be used for a counting index (more on that later). If you ignore this rule, the program will work fine, but you can expect anyone who has to decipher your code in future to get more than a little bit frustrated with your choices.\n\nSome other tips:\n\nIf your code is connected to another document (e.g. you are trying to plot some equation from a paper) then use clearly-related names in both. For example, if your paper has the equation \\(y = \\alpha x +3\\gamma\\), then use the variable names x, y, alpha and gamma in your code. You can even use unicode.\nMake your variable names long enough to be clearly understood, but not too long. At most, you probably want it to be based on two or three words.\nDo not give your variable a name that has a special meaning in Python (e.g. int or sum). Doing so will not always cause problems, but it is a common source of grief.\n\nAbove all, try and develop a consistent style, and name similar quantities in similar ways. For example, the following are individually all reasonable choices for variable names:\nmass_of_helium = 4.003\nneon_mass = 20.180\nmassArgon = 39.948\nmKrypton = 83.798\nmXe = 131.293\nHowever, mixing the different styles within one program is guaranteed to cause you confusion and lead to errors. Pick one format that makes sense to you, and stick with it.\n\nTypes\nAny and every variable has a type. We can ask Python to report on the type of a given variable by using the command type(variable_name). For example,\na = 3\ntype(a)\nwill print int (shorthand for ‘integer’), while\na = 3.0\ntype(a)\nwill print float (i.e., floating-point). We will encounter other types in due course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - Variables and their types\n\n\n\n\n\nTry creating some variables, and using them in simple calculations. Start with the examples above. Be sure to check that the results match what you expect.\nWhat happens if you mix different types, ?\ni = 2\na = 3.0 * i\nprint(type(i), type(a))\nprint(a)\n\nprint(i / 2)\nprint(i / 3)\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

Once a function is written, it can (generally) be used without us needing to know anything about how it works. This is a very powerful concept, and complex programs are often made by chaining many functions together.\nIn general, a function has a well-defined set of inputs (sometimes known as the function’s ‘arguments’) and outputs (sometimes called the ‘return value’). In Python, and most other modern programming languages, a ‘function call’ looks like\nWe have already encountered a couple of functions: we have used print() and type(). These are known as ‘built-in functions’, as they are a core piece of the Python programming language. For a full list of built-ins, see this page of the official Python documentation. Other functions can be accessed by ‘importing’ them from ‘modules’ - we will learn more about this later.\nIt is easy to write your own functions. This is done by using the def command, and writing something like:\nNote that function_name, input1, output1 etc can be any name you wish to use. In general, a function definition comprises: - The keyword def, followed by - The function name, followed by - An opening parenthesis (, followed by - Zero or more input variables, followed by - A closing parenthesis ), followed by - A colon, :\nThis is all followed by an indented block of code containing zero or more lines of the form - The keyword return, followed by - Zero or more variable names (or valid expressions)\nFor example\nWe can then ‘call’ this function:\nThe variable result should now contain the value 7 (= 3 + 5 - 1).\nA few things to notice from this example: - When we ‘call’ (use) a function, we can give it both named variables (a and b), and values (-1). - The variable names we pass to the function don’t need to match the variable names used when ‘declaring’ (defining) the function - so we can use a and b instead of first and second. - The return keyword specifies what the function result will be.\nHere’s a slightly more complicated example, which calculates the sign and absolute value of the input (unless it is zero):",

Some things to think about: - When is the message “Hope that helps !” printed? Why? -\nWhat form does the function result have? What is its type? What about if x has the value 0 ? - What is the role of if/elif/else? (We’ll deal with that question in the next section, but it should be clear enough)\nYou can call this function in two slightly different ways. The first is to write (for example)\nresult = signAndValue(x)\nand the second is to write\nsgn, val = signAndValue(x)\nTry both forms. What type does each result have? What happens if x is 0 ? Look again at the function declaration: can you explain this behaviour?\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nFunction arguments\nThe following function calculates the sum of the integers from n0 to N, inclusive: \\(\\sum_{n=n_0}^N n\\).\ndef sumIntegers(N, n0):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n0, N+1):\n        result += i\n    return result\nNote that the function definition has the upper-limit, N, as the first input argument, contrary to what one might expect - the reason for this will soon become clear.\nIt might usually be the case that we want to start our sum at \\(n_0 = 1\\). Python allows us to provide this as a ‘default’ value for the n0 variable, by simply changing the function declaration:\ndef sumIntegers(N, n0=1):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n0, N+1):\n        result += i\n    return result\nNow, if we call sumIntegers with only one argument, it is assumed that this is N, and n0 receives its default value. However, if we provide two arguments, these are interpreted as N and n0 respectively.\nWe can have multiple arguments with default values. For example, we can extend our function to compute \\(\\sum_{n=n_0}^N n^{\\,p}\\) for some power \\(p\\):\ndef sumIntegers(N, n0=1, p=1):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(n0, N+1):\n        result += i**p\n    return result\nIf we call this specifying one, two, or three arguments, they are assumed to occur in the same order as in the function declaration (i.e. N, n0, p). However, we can also explicitly specify which arguments we wish to set. For example\nresult = sumIntegers(10, p=2)\nwould calculate the sum of squares, leaving n0 set to its default value.\nIf inputs are not labelled, they are assumed to be provided in the same order as in the function definition. The following function displays the value of each argument: you can use it to check you understand the different ways to call a function.\ndef printArgs(a, b, c=17, d=4.3):\n    print(\"a is: \"+str(a))\n    print(\"b is: \"+str(b))\n    print(\"c is: \"+str(c))\n    print(\"d is: \"+str(d))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3 - Optional Arguments / defaults\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the original form of sumIntegers which you can now validate to see if it works as you expected.\nNow modify the function to have n0 be an optional argument with a default value. Does this work as you expected ? When would this behaviour be useful ?\nRun the printArgs function for these cases:\n\nprintArgs(1, 2, 3, 4)\nprintArgs(1, 2, 'a', (1,2,3) )\nprintArgs(2, 1, d=4, c=3 )\n\n\ndef printArgs(a, b, c=17, d=4.3):\n    print(\"a is: \"+str(a))\n    print(\"b is: \"+str(b))\n    print(\"c is: \"+str(c))\n    print(\"d is: \"+str(d))\n\nModify the printArgs function to return the type as well as the value of each argument. Does the default definition set the type ?\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the printArgs() function above does not contain an explicit return statement. It is an example of a function that has ‘side-effects’: it does something that isn’t apparent from knowledge of its outputs. Sometimes, it is necessary to write code with side-effects, especially for data input or output. However, they are a common source of problems, and they should be avoided where possible.\n\n\nScope of variables in functions\nWhen you pass a variable to a function, you effectively create a copy of the information it contains (unless it is a ‘list’ or ‘array’ - more on those in a later exercise!). Changing the variable within the function does not change the value outside the function, unless you pass it back via an output. For example:\ndef increment(x):\n    x += 1\n    print(\"Inside increment, x is now \"+str(x))\n    return x\n\nx = 0\n\nincrement(x) # Notice that we don't do anything with the return value here\nprint(x)      # x will therefore still be zero\nx = increment(x) # This time we are updating the value of x\nprint(x)      # x will be one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 - Variables within functions\n\n\n\n\n\nTry this out, and check you understand what’s going on.\n\ndef increment(x):\n    x += 1\n    print(\"Inside increment, x is now \" + str(x))\n    return x\n\n\nx = 0\nincrement(x)  # Notice that we don't do anything with the return value here\nprint(x)\n...\n\nTry this version of the `increment` function\n\ndef increment():\n    global x\n    x += 1\n    print(\"Inside increment, x is now \" + str(x))\n    return x\n\nIf you leave out the global x then x will be undefined in the function as it does not have access to outside variables.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere is a way to access external (global) variables from within functions. They might be used in this situation:\n\nsystem_is_setup = False\n\n\ndef setup():\n    global system_is_setup\n    if system_is_setup == False:\n        # Do system setup tasks\n        ...\n    else:\n        # check system is ok    \n        ...\n    \n    return \n\nGenerally speaking, functions using global variables in this way is a poor choice of implementation because some hidden code is modifying the global state without us, as users, being in control or even aware. We do often define variables of this nature when we use python objects that have a special internal (private) state. We will learn about this later.\n\n\nFunction documentation\nTo allow anyone to use your function without knowing the details, you need to document it. This appears in the code just after the definition of the function (and other python entities too). This step may seem unimportant at first, but is critical for re-using your code and distributing it to other people ! Another way is to just call help(&lt;functionname&gt;) and it will output the documentation.\n\nhelp(print)\n\n    Help on built-in function print in module builtins:\n\n    print(\\*args, sep=' ', end='\\n', file=None, flush=False) \n        Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\n        \n    sep\n        string inserted between values, default a space.\n    end\n        string appended after the last value, default a newline.\n    file\n        a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.\n    flush\n        whether to forcibly flush the stream.\nDocumentation is provided by writing ‘docstrings’ at the start of any function you create. These consist of blocks of text enclosed in triple inverted commas:\n\"\"\"[Documentation goes here...]\"\"\"\nIn scientific Python, docstrings usually follow a certain style, e.g.:\ndef increment(x):\n    \"\"\"increment x.\n    \n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    x : integer\n        the number you want to increament\n    \n    Returns\n    -------\n    x : integer\n        incremented x\n    \"\"\"\n    x += 1\n    print(\"Inside increment, x is now \"+str(x))\n    return x\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 - Documentation of a function\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck how the documentation string for the increment function works: try changing the documentation to see what happens. Do spaces matter ? Does it matter if the docstring is positioned exactly by the def increment(x): line ?\nNow do the same for the sumIntegers function taking care to indicate default values and what they mean.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nSandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding scratch space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nIn this section we introduce conditional execution which allows us to write algorithms that change their behaviour depending on the nature of the inputs provided.\n\n\nConditional expressions allow us to alter the behaviour of our program depending on the circumstances. To do this, we employ an if...elif...else construct, which takes the form:\nif &lt;condition&gt;:\n    [...]\nelif &lt;another condition&gt;:\n    [...]\nelse:\n    [...]\nHere, each &lt;condition&gt; is a ‘logical’ expression - something which is either ‘true’ or ‘false’. Each [...] denotes a block of code that is only executed if the condition is met. We can have as many elif (‘else if’) blocks as we wish, and we can omit the elif and/or else blocks entirely. At most, one block will be executed: each is tried in the order they appear in the program, until one is found for which &lt;condition&gt; is True. Notice that the else block does not have a condition - this is executed if none of the other conditions are met.\nTo make this clearer, here’s a real example, inside a function:\ndef condExample(x):\n    if x&lt;0:\n        print(\"x is negative\")\n    elif x&lt;=1:\n        print(\"x is between 0 and 1 (inclusive)\")\n    else:\n        print(\"x is greater than 1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1 - if / elif / else\n\n\n\n\n\nTry this function. Does everything behave as you would expect? Try deleting the elif and/or else clauses; how does this affect the output ?\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nLogical expressions\nLogical expressions are calculations that result in either True or False. As we have already seen, they often arise by comparing the value of two variables (or a variable and a constant), such as x &gt; 0. The comparison operators are:\n\n\n\nOperator\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\nGreater than\n\n\n&lt;\nLess than\n\n\n&gt;=\nGreater than or equal to\n\n\n&lt;=\nLess than or equal to\n\n\n==\nEqual to\n\n\n!=\nNot equal to\n\n\n\nYou can check you understand how these work by testing expressions in a Python cell: for example, entering\n3 &gt; 5\nshould evaluate to False.\nNote: an important point is that the constants True or False are Booleans, and not text. So \"True\" (string) is very different of True (Boolean). A possible mistake is to confound them and use \"True\" instead of True. In general, as soon as you want to use something based on a true/false behavior, use Boolean constants in your program.\nTo build more complicated expressions, you can use the Boolean operators and, or and not. An expression of the form A and B is only True if both A and B are separately True. On the other hand, A or B is True if either (or both) of A and B are themselves True. The not operator flips True to False, and vice versa. You can use parentheses to group expressions if necessary.\nFor example:\nx &gt; 3 and (y == 2 or not (y &gt; 3 and x+y ==4) )\nMany logical conditions can be expressed in multiple forms, for example x &gt; 3 is identical to not x &lt;= 3. In general, you should use the simplest form that is appropriate to your circumstances.\nN.B. In some other languages, the symbols & and | are used for and and or. In Python, these symbols are ‘bitwise’ operators, and they will not give the results you expect. We will avoid using them in this course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - &lt;, &gt;, ==\n\n\n\n\n\nTest each of the operators to see if they work as expected. Be careful with the == in real programs x==3 returns True or False but, if you make a typo, x=3 will change x quietly (but 3==x is a valid test, 3=x is a SyntaxError)\nTry using the and, or and not operators.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nTesting for None\nAnother logical operator you may encounter is is. This is used to test whether two variable names refer to the same entity. This is stronger than simply testing for equality. For example:\na = 300\nb = 300\nprint(a is b)\nprint(a == b)\na is b will return False, whereas a is a returns True. This may seem like a pointless detail, but we can define the == and is differently for complicated data structures and objects.\nIt can also be useful to distinguish between a value that has not been set, and a value that is False or 0 etc. where the logical tests may produce unexpected positives. You will often see a null default value within a function:\ndef printHello(name=None):\n    if name is None:\n        print(\"Hello, what is your name?\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Hello \"+name)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding scratch space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nIn this section we introduce loops that allow repeated execution of an algorithm with a defined series of input values.\n\n\nMuch of the power in programming comes from being able to repeat calculations, and change how our program works depending on the values of certain variables along the way. To achieve this, we need to employ ‘loop expressions’ and build on our use of ‘conditional expressions’.\nLoops allow you to repeat a series of calculations a number of times, or until certain conditions are met. In Python, there are two main loop formats.\n\nThe while loop\nThe first is a while loop:\nwhile &lt;condition&gt;:\n    [...]\nHere, &lt;condition&gt; is a logical expression (just like those discussed above). If this evaluates to True, the block of code ([...]) is executed in its entirety. The condition is then evaluated again, and the entire process repeats until it becomes False. For example, here is a loop that keeps doubling a number until it exceeds some threshold:\nx = 1\nwhile x&lt;100:\n    x += x\nprint(x)\nNormally, the entire indented block of code below the while statement is executed before the condition is checked again. However, two commands can be used to alter this:\n\nThe break keyword terminates the loop, jumping to the first statement after the indented block\nThe continue keyword skips over any remaining code within the indented block, but returns to re-evaluate the &lt;condition&gt;, and if this is True will execute the indented block as before.\n\nThese two commands are almost invariably used in conjunction with an if statement.\nFor example:\nx = 1\nwhile x &lt; 100:\n    x+=5\n    if x == 71: \n        break\n    if x%2 == 0: \n        continue # Skip even values of x\n    print(\"In loop: x=\", x)\n\nprint(\"After loop: x=\", x)\nIf you run this code, you will see that it never prints an even number (since the print statement is after the continue in this case, and so doesn’t get executed); moreover, the loop terminates at x=71, due to the break statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1 - While loop\n\n\n\n\n\nTry the while loop example above and modify to see how it works\nWhen you run the while loop code above, you will see that it never prints an even number (since the print statement is after the continue in this case, and so doesn’t get executed); moreover, the loop terminates at x=71, due to the break statement.\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfinite loops\n\n\n\n\n\nInfinite loops can occur if you have no break statement or explicity exit condition.\nInfinite loops will run endlessly if not manually stopped (by sending a termination signal), and are a well known problem since the dawn of computer programming. You will waste a lot of energy if you let the computer spin its wheels this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nBreaking to exit a loop\nSometimes, it may be appropriate to use the following style:\nwhile True:\n    [...]\n    if &lt;condition&gt;: break\n    [...]\nHere, the loop condition is always True, creating an infinite loop. However, the use of a break allows us to escape from the loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - problem solving (i)\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you start with an empty basket and you want to pick apples on a tree. You will make 100 picking moves.\nYou start by picking 2 apples at a time, but after doing this 50 times you get bored. You then pick 5 apples each time, and after doing this a further 25 times, you start picking 10 apples.\nWrite a function containing a loop to return the number of apples in your basket after each pick\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3 - problem solving (ii)\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you take out a $$$500,000 mortgage to buy a house. You make a repayment of $2,000 each month. However, each month the bank charges interest at a rate of 0.3% of the outstanding balance. How many months will it take you to pay off the debt? How much does it cost you?\nWrite a function to calculate this information for any loan amount, interest rate and monthly repayment.

    "text": "Lists\nA list is defined by using square brackets, [ and ], and consists of some set of entries separated by commas, e.g.,\nThe individual entries do not need to have the same type. Also, we can have lists inside lists, e.g.,\nalthough in practice, list elements tend to be more homogenous than the example above.\nWe can access individual entries in the list by adding an index to the variable name. In Python, we have to remember a quirk: when counting objects, we start from 0 rather than from 1; this is because Python is a 0-based programming language. Thus, to access the first entry in the list a, we use a[0]; the second entry is a[1]. We can use these entries in calculations.\nThus:\nWhere an entry in a list is itself a list, we can use a second index to access the elements of this:\nNegative indices count from the last element in the array, which is accessible as a[-1].\nWe can also ask for a range of entries. To do this, we specify the index of the first entry we want, and an index one larger than that of the last entry we want, separated by a colon:\nAgain, this is somewhat quirky. However, it does mean that if we want to extract n entries starting at index i0, we simply need to ask for a[i0:i0+n]. By default, we get every element in the requested range. However, if we only want every \\(k\\)-th element, we can specify k after a second colon, .e.g,\nFinally, we can use shorthands such as a[:4] (everything from the start up to element a[3], inclusive), a[3:] (everything from a[3] to the end) and a[::2] (every second element, starting with a[0]).\nWe can change the values stored within an element of a list:\nLists are therefore said to be ‘mutable’. However, note that we need to explicitly change the list entry:\nUnlike most other variables in Python, a list variable stores a reference to the list, rather than the list itself. This means that two different variable names can refer to the same memory address, and is a common (and counter-intuitive) source of errors. For example\nNotice that the list referred to by a has changed, even though we have not explicitly altered it! This behaviour is different from ‘normal’ variables.\nIf you wish to create a copy of a list, you will need to use the ‘copy’ function:\nIf we ‘add’ two lists together, we create a new list containing the elements from each:\nOne can ‘grow’ a list:\nHowever, if you need to build a large list, this is a very inefficient way of doing it, and your program will probably end up being very slow.\nPython provides a number of standard functions for working with lists. A few of the more important ones are detailed below, where we suppose a is a list:",

The key difference is that tuples are immutable, so that once a tuple is created it cannot subsequently be changed. (It can be extended – but this is effectively the creation of a new, larger tuple!) As with lists, the individual elements of a tuple can be accessed using [index] after the tuple name, e.g.\na = (3, 4, 5)\nprint(a[1]) # Prints `4`\nAgain, Python provides a number of functions for working with a tuple (‘a’), including:\n\nlen(a)\nmin(a)\nmax(a)\na.index(x)\na.count(x)\n\nall of which are similar to their counterparts for lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 - functions that work on tuples\n\n\n\n\n\nTry these out!

To some extent, this is a matter of style and preference. In general, the advice is that all the entries in a list should be ‘the same kind of data’, whereas the entries in a tuple are likely to represent different entitites. For example, if we have an experimental dataset that consists of observations of pressure and temperature at a sequence of time points, it might be appropriate to represent each observation as a tuple of (pressure, temperature), and then the sequence of observations as a list of these tuples [(p1, T1), (p2, T2), (p3, T3),...].\nThere is a key difference between tuples and lists, though. An immutable data type can be used as a key in a dictionary. So we can use a tuple as a tag for other kinds of data. We haven’t explored what a key for a dictionary means, so let’s do that now.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nIn this section we go deeper into the concept of loops with the concept of a for loop and discuss the concept of an iterable object (a python object that returns a sequence of values one after the other when asked).\n\n\nWe have already encountered one way of repeating calculations - the while loop. Python also provides a second kind of loop, the for loop. This allows us to do a calculation for each of the entries in a list, tuple or dictionary (or, more generally, any object that can yield a well-defined return value each time it is called).\n\nThe For loop\nTypically, a for loop takes the form:\nfor &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;collection&gt;:\n    [calculations using &lt;variable&gt;]\nAs with the while loop, everything within the indented block is executed multiple times, with the &lt;variable&gt; getting set equal to a different element of &lt;collection&gt; on each pass. &lt;collection&gt; may be any ‘iterable’, such as a list. For example, the following code would calculate the sum of all the entries in a:\na = [1, 5, 9]\ns = 0\nfor x in a:\n    s += x\n    print(x, s)\nprint(\"Total is:\", s)\nIt is possible to use continue [go to the next iteration immediately] and break [terminate the loop immediately] statements within a for loop, just as in a while loop.\nOften, we simply want to perform a calculation \\(n\\) times, counting off as we go. To allow this, Python provides the range function, which is a special kind of iterable. It can be used as follows:\nn = 20\nfor i in range(n):\n    print(i)\nBy default, the counting starts from 0, and continues up to \\(n-1\\) (so that there are a total of \\(n\\) passes through the loop). If you want to start from a different number, you can provide this:\nistart = 3\nistop = 15\nfor i in range(istart, istop):\n    print(i)\nNotice that the counting starts with istart, and finishes with istop-1. We can also count in increments of istep:\nistart = 3\nistop = 15\nistep = 4\n\nfor i in range(istart, istop, istep):\n    print(i)\nThis will print istart, istart + istep, istart + 2*istep etc, but not any value equal to or greater than istep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1 - Try out the for loop\n\n\n\n\n\nRewrite our previous while loop test-case as a for loop. Note that the full syntax of the range function is range(start, end, step) which allows you to skip by 5 as we previously did. You may need to read the help and try the examples above.\nx = 1\nwhile x &lt; 100:\n    x+=5\n    if x == 71: \n        break\n    if x%2 == 0: \n        continue # Skip even values of x\n    print(\"In loop: x=\", x)\n\nprint(\"After loop: x=\", x)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nA loop to calculate \\(\\pi\\)\nThe value of \\(\\pi\\) can be found via an infinite sum \\(\\pi = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty 2^k (k!)^2 / (2k+1)!\\), where \\(n!\\) denotes the factorial of \\(n\\), i.e., \\(n! = n(n-1)(n-2)\\ldots 1\\). This can be computed by initialising a variable to contain the value 1, and then looping through the integers up to n multiplying the variable by each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - \\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nBy summing the first \\(N\\) terms in the series, compute an approximation to \\(\\pi\\) and explore how the accuracy of the approximation changes with \\(N\\). A good starting point is \\(N = 20\\).\n\n# A series that converges to the value of $\\pi$\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenumerations\nOften, we may need to iterate through a collection of objects (such as a list), but also keep a count of how many objects we have dealt with.\nThere are various ways this could be done - one might be:\na = [3, 5, 7]\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    print(\"Object number\", i, \" is \", a[i])\nHowever, Python provides the enumerate function for precisely this purpose:\na = [3, 5, 7]\nfor i, ai in enumerate(a):\n    print(\"Object number\", i, \" is \", ai)\nThe iterable created by enumerate returns a tuple of (index, object) pairs, which can be assigned to a pair of variables (here, i and ai).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - using enumerate\n\n\n\n\n\nTry the example for enumerate (above). Check for yourself for different enumerations. For example, use range(12, 24, 3) as your iterable.\n\n# test the use of enumerate ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip\nAnother common circumstance is that we have two (or more) collections, and we want to access the \\(i\\)-th element of each simultaneously. Again, this could be achieved using something like:\na = [3, 5, 7]\nb = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nfor i in range(len(a)):\n    print(\"The letter associated with \", a[i], \" is \", b[i])\nbut Python also provides the zip function for this purpose:\na = [3, 5, 7]\nb = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nfor ai, bi in zip(a, b):\n    print(\"The letter associated with \", ai, \" is \", bi)\nThis creates an iterator which returns a tuple on each iteration, containing the \\(i\\)-th element of each of the collections passed to zip. The elements of this tuple can be assigned to variables (here, ai and bi).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3 - using zip\n\n\n\n\n\nip may be a little bit hard to understand unless you try it (and try, try, try again). Try the example and mess around until it sinks in\n\n# test the use of zip ...\n\n\nlist comprehension loops\nFinally, a for loop can be used to initialise a list. This is quite a common occurence in python code you may find online, but is hard to understand when you first see it. You will often see the following shorthand:\n&lt;list&gt; = [ &lt;expression involving variable&gt; for &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;collection&gt; ]\ne.g.\na = [i**2 for i in range(3, 13, 2)]\nThis is sometimes known as a list comprehension. A tuple can be built similarly\na = tuple(i**2 for i in range(3, 13, 2))\nand\na = {x:y for x, y in zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3])}\ncan be used to construct a dictionary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 - list comprehension loop\n\n\n\n\n\nTry the examples above … they really do work even if they look quite hard to follow. Maybe you don’t feel confident writing code like this (in which case - don’t, it’s not important to do fancy things) but it is important to be able to understand what is done if you come across this idiomatic code.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime numbers\nThe Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for finding prime numbers (i.e., integers which are not divisible by any other integers except themselves and one). Suppose you want to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to 25. First, you write down a list of all the numbers from 2 up to 25:\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n\n\n\nNow, you start crossing out numbers. First, we consider the first entry in the list, 2. We keep this, but cross out every second number thereafter:\n2 3 X 5 X 7 X 9 X 11 X 13 X 15 X 17 X 19 X 21 X 23 X 25\n^Start here\nWe move our pointer to the next not-crossed-out number, 3. We then cross out every 3rd entry (counting ones that are already crossed out):\n2 3 X 5 X 7 X X X 11 X 13 X X X 17 X 19 X X X 23 X 25\n  ^Start here\nThe next not-crossed out number is 5, so we remove every 5th entry:\n2 3 X 5 X 7 X X X 11 X 13 X X X 17 X 19 X X X 23 X X\n      ^Start here\nIf we continue this procedure, we will find that we do not cross out any more numbers. The remaining numbers - 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 and 23 - are all the primes less than (or equal to) 25.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5 - prime number computation\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite a function that takes a single input, \\(N\\), and returns the list of all prime numbers less than \\(N\\). Hint: use the ‘sieve of Eratosthenes’ that we just told you about ! Also: use a for loop !\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding scratch space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

The code s%x combines the two, resulting in the contents of x being inserted into the string s, formatted as required.\nAll placeholders begin with the ‘%’ symbol. Integer placeholders end with the letter ‘i’, floating-point placeholders end with the letter ‘f’, and string placeholders end with the letter ‘s’. Between the ‘%’ and the letter, one can specify various options controlling the exact form of output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaceholder\nDescription\nExample\nOutput\n\n\n\n\n%i\nGeneral integer (no further formatting specified)\n'%i'%3\n‘3’\n\n\n%3i\nInteger, at least 3 characters wide\n'%3i'%3\n'  3'\n\n\n%03i\nInteger, at least 3 characters wide, zero-padded\n'%03i'%3\n'003'\n\n\n%f\nGeneral floating-point number (no format specified)\n'%f'%2.9\n‘2.900000’\n\n\n%12f\nFloating-point number, occupying at least 12 characters\n'%12f'%2.9\n'    2.900000'\n\n\n%012f\nFloating-point number, occupying at least 12 characters, zero-padded\n'%012f'%2.9\n'00002.900000'\n\n\n%8.2f\nFloating-point number, occupying at least 8 characters, rounded to two decimal places\n'%8.2f'%2.9\n'    2.90'\n\n\n%s\nGeneral string (no format specified)\n'%s'%'test'\n'test'\n\n\n%10s\nString, occupying at least 10 characters\n'%10s'%'test'\n'      test'\n\n\n%%\nLiteral ‘%’ character\n'%6.2f%%'%2.9\n'  2.90%'\n\n\n\nWhere a string contains more than one placeholder, we can pass the required information as a tuple:\nphrase = '%i litres of %s at $%.2f/L costs a total of $%.2f'\nprint(phrase%(2, 'milk', 1.29, 2*1.29))\nprint(phrase%(40, 'petrol', 1.53, 40*1.53))\nprint(phrase%(7.5, 'water', 0.17, 7.5*0.17))\nSometimes, it may be necessary to use string formatting to write the placeholders, allowing the style of output to be set at runtime:\ndef print_result(result,number_of_decimal_places):\n    fmt = \"The result is %%.%if\"\n    print((fmt%number_of_decimal_places)%result)\nHowever, this is best avoided if possible.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA second, newer approach to formatting uses braces {} instead of %... to represent a placeholder, and a .format() function that can act on any string. The syntax of the format specifiers is also different. Our example would become:\nx = 1/11\nprint(x)\ns = \"One eleventh is approximately {:.2f}\"\nprint(s)\nprint(s.format(x))\nSimilarly,\nphrase = '{} litres of {} at ${:.2f}/L costs a total of ${:.2f}'\nprint(phrase.format(2, 'milk', 1.29, 2*1.29))\nprint(phrase,format(40, 'petrol', 1.53, 40*1.53))\nprint(phrase.format(7.5, 'water', 0.17, 7.5*0.17))\nThe new approach provides a much richer set of formatting options, described in full in the online documentation. One benefit of the new style is that it is no longer necessary to pass information to format in the same order as it is used: we can number the placeholders. For example,\nphrase = '{3} litres of {0} at ${1:.2f}/L costs a total of ${2:.2f}'\nprint(phrase.format('milk', 1.29, 2*1.29, 2))\nprint(phrase,format('petrol', 1.53, 40*1.53, 40))\nprint(phrase.format('water', 0.17, 7.5*0.17, 7.5))\nThis is particularly useful if you need to repeat the same information several times in a string:\nphrase = \"This sentence has the word {0} {0} {0} repeated three times and the word {1} {1} repeated twice.\"\nprint(phrase.format('cat', 'dog'))\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding scratch space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "title": "Reading and writing files",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Summary\n\n\n\nIn this section we learn about data-file handling (reading / writing information) which is a pre-cursor to doing useful computing at scale. We will use some very low-level tools to read and write to storage. In practice, we would probably use packages that can read common data formats, download data from the web, or work with datasets that are too large to read all at once.\n\n\nUp to this point, we have typed all the data for our programs in ‘by hand’. However, as you have no doubt noticed, this quickly gets tedious. It is useful to be able to read and write data files, allowing information to be stored and shared with other people.\nIn order to read a data file, we need to understand what information it contains, and how this has been encoded. This is generally referred to as the ‘file format’. Different programs produce files in different formats - a photograph in .jpeg format cannot be read by a spreadsheet package, which might expect to receive files in .xlsx format.\nThe simplest file format for storing and transferring scientific data is a plain text file in ‘ascii’ (‘American Standard Code for Information Exchange’) format. This is the sort of file that can be read and produced using a simple text editor such as ‘notepad’ (on Windows) or ‘TextEdit’ (on a Mac). Commonly, such files will have an extension such as .txt or .dat.\nReading ascii files in Python is a four-step process: 1. Open the file; 2. Read each line from the file; 3. Parse each line (i.e., extract the required information from it); 4. Close the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Code (run this first !)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe need to make sure the data file we are going to use is saved on your computer so we first have to make a copy into the sandbox file system we are using (this area is deleted whenever we reload this page)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can check to see if the file is available\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\nReading data from a file\nTo open a file, we use the open() function, which returns a file object. It is important to assign this to a variable (here, fp) so that we can continue to access the open file.\nfilename = 'sample.dat'\nfp = open(filename, 'r')\nHere, filename is a variable holding the file name (or file path and name, if it is not in our current working directory), and the second argument, 'r', specifies that we want to open the file for reading only.\nOnce the file is open, we can read from it. There are various ways of doing this, but for small files the simplest method is generally to call the readlines() function, which returns the entire file in the form of a list:\nlines = fp.readlines()\nEach element of the list lines is now a string, containing one of the lines from the file sample.dat. Since we have read all the information in the file, we can now close the file:\nfp.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1 - Read the sample.dat file\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen the file and print out the individual lines to see what it contains.\nHere is a hint that you might see in python code elsewhere. If you precede a structure like a tuple or list with a ’ * ’ then it is unpacked before being used. This might be helpful if you want to make the list of lines look more like the original file when printed. Another way would be to write a loop over all the lines and print them individually.\n\n    t = (1,2,3,4)\n    print(t)\n    print(*t)\n\n    # Output:\n    # (1, 2, 3, 4)\n    # 1 2 3 4\n\n\n    l = ['a', 'b', 'c', '...', 'z']\n    print(l)\n    print(*l)\n\n    # Output:\n    # ['a', 'b', 'c', '...', 'z']\n    # a b c ... z\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\npython with statement\nOpening and closing files explicitly is useful to illustrate how Python handles reading and writing files. However, doing this in practice can get quite messy because these ‘connections’ to files stay open until you explicitly close them. With single files, this can lead to data corruption and data loss, with more complex scripts you might open 10,000 files and not close any of them - you may then run into some limit on the system that will block your script or may block some other work that you are trying to do.\nPython has a really handy construct for dealing with this issue automatically and you will doubtless see code that uses ‘context managers’ aka with statements.\nThis is not a very intuitive choice of language but, once you recognise what is happening, you will be able to understand python programs more easily. Any time you have an action which needs some clearing-up to be done afterwards, the context manager handles everything behind the scenes.\nIn the case of reading/writing files, you create a ‘context’ that contains a connection to a file, which is automatically closed when the code within the context is finished. This is a bit complicated to follow, but file-management is a very clear example of how it works.\nfilename = 'sample.dat'\nwith open(filename, 'r') as fp:\n    lines = fp.readlines()\n    ...\n    ...\n\n    # fp.close() is handled automatically here\nThe with statement tells python that the file you’re giving it is only used in the following indented code, and can be closed afterwards. This performs exactly the same as manually opening and closing the file, as above, but automatically cleans up after you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2 - context manager\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you test to see if the fp was closed / deleted after the statement completed ? What about the contents of the file, are they available once the with statement is done ?\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOnce you have a list of strings, you can use the list- and string-parsing tools we have already encountered to extract the necessary data and store it in appropriate data structures. The file sample.dat contains records of the mass and volume of twenty samples of a given material.\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=true icon=“false”}\n\n\nExercise 3 - work with the data\nRead the data from this file, compute the density of each sample and hence the average density of the material.\n\nYou will need to parse the individual strings and store the information for your calculations.\nOutput the information to the screen with print statements so that you can validate your results.\n\n:::\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nWriting data to a file\nWe don’t want to have to repeat this work once the processing is done, so we would like to write out the new information to a file.\nTo write data to file, we need to first open the file for writing. This can be done by using ‘w’ instead of ‘r’ when opening the file. Note that if a file already exists with the specified name, it will be immediately overwritten and lost. To avoid this, you can instead use ‘x’ when opening the file. This will throw an error if there is an existing file, rather than overwrite it. Again, when opening the file it is important to assign the result of open() to a variable, so we can write to it.\nOnce the file is open, we can write any text strings to it by calling the write() function. Remember, to insert a new line, you use the symbol '\\n', otherwise everything will be on a single line:\nfp.write(\"Hello!\\n\")\nfp.write(\"This is some text to store in a file... \")\nline = \"The file has only two lines.\"\nfp.write(line)\nOnce everything is written to the file, call close() to close it.\nfp.close()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4 - write data to a new file\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new file, based on the data you read earlier. It should contain three columns: mass, sample volume and sample density. All quantities should be in SI units.\n*Remember, you can use the string-formatting tools we encountered in the last exercise to control how your numbers are written out. Verify that the file has been correctly written (e.g. Exercise 1)\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFrom the examples above, we just saw how to read and write data using Python built-in methods. These are good for simple files, but not for more complex information such as an Excel spreadsheet. Later in the course, we will encounter a number of more sophisticated tools that can help us with these kinds of files.\n\n\nSandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoding scratch space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "What is version control ?\nVersion control is the practice of keeping a record of all the times you edit a file, all the changes you make and a record of the intent of those changes. This is a form of version control:\nThis is great because you have a record of all of your changes but already you can see that there are problems when you make multiple sets of changes at once. Version control software packages aim to help with this. They formalise common practices like tagging file names (the example above) and they add a whole suite of extra tools to make collaboration easier.\nThe other form of version control that you may already have encountered is track changes in microsoft word or the time machine version system that you can find on the Mac.\nThese kinds of backup-based version control ideas are fine but they are very linear in the way changes are managed. As you can see above, there can be genuine issues when two people contribute to a file. While you are waiting for your supervisor to comment on draft version 1.0 of your thesis you almost certainly would like to start work on v1.1. When you have changes in v1.0 suggested by your supervisor you have to go through and figure out what changes you need to make to v1.1 to make a new version before you can get cracking on v1.2.\nImagine how much more complicated this becomes when many people are working on a single project and may all be editing a single file together.",

    "text": "What is git and what is GitHub\nYou can use the software git by yourself on your own computer to manage version control of a project. However, the real benefits to using a tool like git come when you use a networked repository of your software which you can access from multiple machines and synchronise from machine to machine when you are ready. Not only can you do this, but your collaborators can access and edit files and then, later, you can merge the changes in an organised way.\nWe have a shared space on github which is a centralised web site that coordinates various git repositories. We will have a shared repository and I will also show you how to manage your own repositories using git and github. There are other sites quite like github (gitlab and bitbucket spring to mind) but that is for you to investigate and make a choice later. You can stick with git on these other sites.\ngithub also bundles a host of project management tools alongside your files and that is something that can be very helpful for teams of people or a class.\n\nReference links for our class\n\nAll of the material for these notes is available at https://github.com/ANU-RSES-Education/EMSC-4033\nWhen you ask for one of the live pages to be executed, you are directed to a server which does this;\n\nauthenticates you (or uses saved credentials)\nsynchronises the changes you have made with any changes that have been made in the original repository\n\nIf we add an exercise or some new material, it will be copied into your account\nIf we find a bug and change an existing notebook, the changes will be merged\nIf our changes clash with yours, yours are kept\n\nThe page is then displayed and the code is available for you to try.\n\nTo be able to do this complicated merge, the revision control is made to work overtime. The package doing this is called nbgitpuller.\nBecause nbgitpuller is active and synchronising with the EMSC4033 repository, we won’t be using version control ourselves. However, using an online repository is a very sensible habit to get into if you aren’t already hooked.\n\n\n\nHow to use git for yourself\nWe recommend this tutorial: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/learn-git-with-bitbucket-cloud. It focuses on the bitbucket online repository rather than GitHub but the principles are similar.\nEven in a single-user project, writing “issues” and using automatic testing is a really good idea.\nMost online repositories have some sort of built-in computation. You can do things like run a test suite every time an important file changes. You can also use it to build web pages when you update your content.\nThat’s what we are doing to make the online book for this course - the repository rebuilds the web pages if any of the content changes because of some scripts we built in to the repository (see it in action here ). This takes the concept of literate programming one step further - the programs are self-documenting as well as self executing.\nYou can read about another example here which shows how to regularly run a notebook that processes some data and uploads an image that is linked within a web page. One of the repositories doing the work is https://github.com/ANU-RSES-Education/SeismicNoise_AuSIS_UHS and this is the latest image:\n\n\n\n```zymhpkaw https://github.com/ANU-RSES-Education/SeismicNoise_AuSIS_UHS/raw/master/results/latest.png\n\n\n\n\nwidth: 80%\n\n\nname: ulladulla\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the change in human behaviour due to COVID lockdowns was most dramatically observed in the data recorded by the Australian Seismometers in Schools (AuSiS) network. These instruments are research-quality seismometers that are maintained by school students — our next generation of geophysicists. The usual hum of the children (and teachers) during the school day, observed in the movement between classrooms, and during lunchtimes or Saturday morning sports, abruptly stopped at locations such as Ulladulla High School on the south coast of New South Wales (above). ```",

    "text": "Different file types and text editing\nOur previous exercise in combining files showed how git tries to merge information from different version of files when it can parse the file and understand what it actually is. The tools that it uses are reasonable in the case of text files but largely meaningless in the case of binary files (like images, .docx files, etc). Git can only work out that there is a new version of the file and complain, it cannot try to merge. You can tell git to ignore specific types of files (using a .gitignore file in the project) and if you are planning a project with a lot of image files you might want to read about it here.\nLine-by-line comparison is also not ideal for writing code where code-blocks span multiple lines. Git’s merging strategy may have problems if edits are made in the middle of a code block that might, in principle mess up the syntax. For example, imagine if you change a line which has a closing parenthesis for a multi-line function definition.\nThese are issues that are avoided by\n\nNot trying to version inappropriate file types\nMaking regular commits of small changes\nAnticipating trouble and working around it\nUsing the other tools available in github to communicate with your collaborators and plan changes carefully.\nBranches (see this page in the tutorial\n\n```cxkejwwllnz ipython3\n```",
